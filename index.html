        <p class="summaryPAR">CT-2224 commonly known as Commander Cody was a high ranking
            clone in the Grand Army of the Republic who fought in the Clone Wars during the
            final years of the Galactic Republic. Born on the ocean covered world of Kamino,
            he was trained and engineered to be the perfect soldier. He was in command of the 7th Sky Corps
            which included it's renowned subunit the 212th Attack Batallion. He was known to be
            trustworthy, loyal and reliable to General Kenobi and his fellow clones. Cody took
            part in multiple major battles during the Clone Wars such as the Second Battle of Geonosis
            and the Battle of Utapau. Along with Obi Wan Kenobi, he also formed a friendship with
            CT-7567, known as Captian Rex. Unlike his clone friend, Cody obeys order 66 while Rex helps
            his Jedi commander escape. He went on to serve the Galactic Empire where he helped train 
            the new human recruits into Stormtroopers.
