            <h1 class="wartitle1">The Clone Wars: 22BBY-19BBY</h1>
            <p class="warpar1">
                The Clone Wars (22-19 BBY) was a galaxy-spanning conflict between 
                the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems,
                which had seceded from the Republic. Also referred to as the Clone War,
                it was named after the clone troopers used by the Grand Army of the Republic
                against the Separatist Droid Army. With both being fielded in enormous numbers
                by each respective side, they were the largest military forces in galactic
                history, and fighting between them swept through the galaxy for three, 
                nearly four, years.
                <br>
                <br>
                Unbeknownst to the majority of those involved—combatants and bureaucrats
                alike—the conflict was orchestrated, facilitated, instigated, and eventually 
                resolved by Darth Sidious, whose ultimate goal was to restore the Sith Empire 
                and to transform the Republic into the Galactic Empire with himself as Emperor, 
                as well as the complete eradication of the Jedi Order. Sidious was deceiving both sides.
                Sidious's deception was eventually exposed by Sidious himself who revealed himself as the
                Sith Lord and cause of the Clone Wars. Evading arrest by Mace Windu and a cadre of Jedi, 
                Sidious would succeed in this endeavor with the aid of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who Sidious 
                seduced to the dark side of the Force and molded into his new apprentice Darth Vader. Sidious publicly 
                branded the Jedi as traitors and triggered Order 66, which forced the Republic's clone troopers to betray
                and execute their Jedi Generals, thereby initiating a galaxy-wide Great Jedi Purge. Palpatine then 
                declared an end to the Clone Wars in an extraordinary session of the Senate and proclaimed the transformation
                of the Republic into the First Galactic Empire, and the Galactic Senate into the Imperial Senate.

                    1. BATTLE OF CHRISTOPHSIS
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Early during the Clone Wars, members of the 7th Sky Corps
                    were dispatched to a series of battles on a rocky planet, the 
                    siege of Hisseen, and, seven weeks into the war, Christophsis alongside
                    Jedi General Anakin Skywalker's 501st Legion. As such, the corps fought in 
                    the Battle of Christophsis against Separatist forces, eventually emerging 
                    victorious and subsequently participating in the Battle of Teth.

                    2. BATTLE OF RYLOTH
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The 7th Sky Corps participated in the Battle of Ryloth, and were the first to secure 
                    a landing zone on the planet for the rest of Republic forces after Ghost Company of the
                    212th Attack Battalion, a battalion of the 7th Sky Corps, were deployed to liberate the 
                    city of Nabat. Led by Kenobi, the troops advanced through the city without use of heavy
                    weaponry as not to decimate the town they were fighting to save. When Cody and Wooley discovered
                    that the tactical droid commander TX-20 was holding the Twi'lek's hostage in the middle of the 
                    city, the group planned a surprise attack and eventually liberated the Nabat. After the rest of
                    Republic forces landed, the 7th Sky Corps moved and eventually secured the Jixuan desert, bringing 
                    Ryloth's southern hemisphere under Republic control. Eventually, Ryloth was liberated from Separatist
                    control.

                    3. SECOND BATTLE OF GEONOSIS
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The 7th Sky Corps' 212th Recon Division was the first unit to launch from their assault ship, and the force
                    consisted of LAAT/i gunships and LAAT carriers transporting AT-TEs. Skywalker's team was the next to follow, 
                    and then Mundi's special ops forces. Engaged by J-1 proton cannons, LR1K sonic cannons, and Nantex-class territorial
                    defense starfighters, the Republic forces suffered heavy casualties, with only the 212th Recon Division reaching the 
                    rendezvous at Point Rain. Commander Cody established a perimeter with LAAT/i gunships and AT-TEs to hold their position
                    against overwhelming Geonosian forces. During the battle, Kenobi's gunship was shot down, with Kenobi and clone trooper 
                    Trapper being the only survivors. They were eventually rescued by troopers Boil and Waxer. As the battle progressed, the
                    212th became more and more overwhelmed until Red Squadron — a squadron of BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bombers — arrived for 
                    air support and Skywalker and Mundi's units arrived at Point Rain.

                        4. BATTLE OF LOLA SAYU
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Battle of Lola Sayu, also called the mission to the Citadel, was a battle fought during the Clone Wars between the 
                        Grand Army of the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems in and around the Citadel, a Separatist prison on
                        Lola Sayu. Launched as a mission to infiltrate the Citadel, Jedi and clone troopers led a rescue of Jedi Master Even Piell,
                        Captain Wilhuff Tarkin, and their clone forces; Piell and Tarkin had discovered the coordinates of the hyperspace lane known
                        as the Nexus Route, which they believed could prove vital to the Republic's war effort. Though Piell was killed, Tarkin and 
                        his forces were rescued and brought the information to the Galactic Republic.

                        5. BATTLE OF UMBARA
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        General Kenobi arrived with the 212th in the south and began their attack on the local militia, along with Pong Krell and Saesee Tiin.
                        However the Umbaran Militia's powerful technology and the dangerous wildlife conditions prevented a swift capture of the Capital forcing
                        Kenobi's forces into prolonged skirmishes around the Capital outskirts. Therefore Kenobi was forced to rely on the 501st for their support
                        until his forces could find an opening in the Capital's defences. Meanwhile the 501st under temporary command by General Krell captured an
                        Umbaran Airbase that was helping the Seperatists hold of the 212th troops.While the 501st's Clone Captian Rex argued with Krell, the airbase
                        received a transmission from a clone scout, informing them that the Umbarans were preparing another offensive, possibly with the aid of clone armor
                        and weapons captured from a platoon. Krell decided on a preemptive strike. The troops moved out, but soon ran into a firefight and began targeting 
                        what they believed to be the enemy in disguise. Rex, curious if the enemies were actually Umbaran, took off the helmet of one of the killed "clones" 
                        and was horrified to find out that they were firing on each other. Rex immediately ran to the middle of the battlefield and yelled at both sides to 
                        take off their helmets, and both the 501st and 212th Attack Battalion were horrified to learn that they had slaughtered each other. This attack was
                        planned by General Krell who betrayed the Republic. However before he could stop the clones from winning, a 501st trooper known as Dogma executed
                        the Jedi General for killing dozens of 501st clones.
